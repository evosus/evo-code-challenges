# Code Challenge - Kubernetes
#### Package a web application in a Docker container image, and run that container image on a Kubernetes Engine cluster as a load-balanced set of replicas that can scale to the needs of your users.


##### Getting Started Hints:
* Create/Use a free trial Google Cloud Console account
* Create/Clone a Hello World App from Google Cloud (Just a simple nodejs server app rendering 'Hello World' in the browser)

**Expectations:** *Research and demonstrate your web application packaged and deployed to Kubernetes Engine.*

If you run into issues... DON'T FREAK OUT, just breathe! Try your best and if you hit a wall just write out your thought process and the step(s) you would take next to find a resolution to your problem.
